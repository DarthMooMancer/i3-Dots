These dotfiles use chezmoi

Here is a setup if you want to make your own dotfiles:
https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/#concepts

However to copy these you need to install chezmoi with you package manager:
Ex. Arch - sudo pacman -S chezmoi

Once installed to copy my dots use - "chezmoi init --apply DarthMooMancer", excluding the quotes. This will install the dots and that is it. 
In order to update the dots later on you can run:

"chezmoi update"
